                    <p>BitRights is a proof of concept project for blockchain based digital copyright protection. Users can upload media files that they create and permanently 
                        claim ownership of their work. Anyone on the web can view the published works and verify that the author is correct. Further, it is not possible to 
                        upload a work that is too similar to one that has already been published. Audio, image, and text files are currently supported.</p>

                    <div class="dropdown-divider"></div>

                    <p>1st Run: Run the following commands from inside the project directory<br/>
                        <kbd>source ./install.sh</kbd><br/>
                        <kbd>python network.py</kbd></p>
                    

                    <p class="mt-2">Subsequent Runs:<br/>
                        <kbd>source ./run.sh</kbd></p>
                    
                    
                    <h3 class="mt-2">How it Works</h3>
                    <div class="dropdown-divider"></div>
                    <p>Whenever a user uploads a file, a new block is added to the blockchain. This block contains the title and author of the work, a path/link to download the 
                        file, a hash of the file, the public key of the author, the timestamp, and the hash of the previous block. A hash of the file is used instead of the raw 
                        data to keep block sizes smaller. The public key of the author is included so that knowledge of the corresponding secret key allows the author to prove 
                        ownership. Like any blockchain, the hash of the previous block allows users to verify that the chain has not been tampered with.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Media Comparison</h3>
                    <div class="dropdown-divider"></div>
                    <p>In order for a block to be considered valid, the uploaded work must not be too similar to any previous files on the chain. We use perceptual hashing to perform 
                    this comparison. A perceptual hash generates a short fingerprint for a file, such that small changes to the file only result in small changes to the fingerprint. 
                    Then if the fingerprints are too similar, it is safe to conclude that the files are too similar. To create the fingerprints, we use open source software that was 
                    made for this purpose.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-3">Limitations</h3>
                    <div class="dropdown-divider"></div>
                    <p>In practice, the blockchain should not be hosted from a single server. A major advantage of using a blockchain is that there is no trusted authority for what is on 
                    the chain. In order to achieve this, we would need to add a lot of code for networking and communication between worker nodes. We also have not implemented a way of 
                    preventing adversarial mining. Proof of work could potentially be used, but there is currently no reward for successfully mining a block. If this was implemented, 
                    there would need to be transaction fees so that miners would have incentive to publish blocks.</p>
                    
                    <p>Another limitation is that as the blockchain grows, comparing new fingerprints with all of the old ones becomes increasingly computationally difficult. Perhaps 
                    probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs) could be used to speed up the verification process. Scalability seems to be the largest hurdle if this project were to be 
                    implemented in the real world.</p>
